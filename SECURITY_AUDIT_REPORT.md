# Security Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-10-31  
**Auditor:** GitHub Copilot Security Agent  
**Repository:** apsolut-public/webdev-toolbox  
**Scope:** Complete repository scan for API leaks, secrets, and security vulnerabilities

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was performed on the webdev-toolbox repository. One **CRITICAL** security vulnerability was discovered and remediated, along with several minor security improvements.

### Critical Finding
- **Malicious preinstall.js script** containing obfuscated code designed to compromise developer systems

### Overall Risk Assessment
- **Before Audit:** CRITICAL - Active malware present
- **After Remediation:** LOW - All critical issues resolved

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. CRITICAL: Malicious preinstall.js Script

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Description:**
The repository contained a malicious `preinstall.js` file that executed automatically during `npm install`. The file contained heavily obfuscated JavaScript that:

1. Connected to external Solana blockchain endpoints (`api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`)
2. Fetched transaction data to retrieve remote command-and-control URLs
3. Attempted to download and execute remote code
4. Tried to exfiltrate data from the developer's system
5. Attempted to write malicious scripts to the filesystem

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// Obfuscated code using unicode encoding
const d=s=>[...s].map(c=>(c=c.codePointAt(0)...
eval(Buffer.from(d(`󠅦󠅑󠅢󠄐...`)).toString('utf-8'));
```

**Remediation:**
- ✅ Deleted `preinstall.js` file
- ✅ Removed `"preinstall": "node preinstall.js"` from package.json scripts
- ✅ Verified npm install works safely without malicious code

**Impact:**
Any developer who ran `npm install` with this code present may have had:
- System information collected
- Credentials potentially exposed
- Remote code executed on their system

**Recommendations for Users:**
If you installed dependencies before 2025-10-31:
1. Delete `node_modules` folder
2. Run `npm cache clean --force`
3. Pull latest repository changes
4. Review system for suspicious activity
5. Rotate any credentials that may have been exposed

---

### 2. MEDIUM: Information Disclosure via Console Logging

**Severity:** LOW  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Description:**
The NotFound.tsx component logged user navigation paths to the browser console, potentially exposing sensitive URL parameters or user navigation patterns.

**Evidence:**
```javascript
console.error(
  "404 Error: User attempted to access non-existent route:",
  location.pathname
);
```

**Remediation:**
- ✅ Removed console.error statement
- ✅ Removed unused useEffect import

**Impact:**
Minor information disclosure. User navigation patterns could be observed through browser console.

---

### 3. MEDIUM: Missing Environment File Protection

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Description:**
The `.gitignore` file did not include comprehensive patterns for environment files, risking accidental commit of secrets.

**Remediation:**
Added comprehensive environment file patterns to .gitignore:
```
.env
.env.local
.env.development
.env.test
.env.production
.env*.local
```

**Impact:**
Prevents future accidental commits of API keys, tokens, or other secrets stored in environment files.

---

## Positive Findings

### ✅ No Hardcoded Secrets
- No API keys, tokens, or passwords found in source code
- No authentication credentials in configuration files
- No private keys or certificates committed

### ✅ Client-Side Only Application
- All tools run entirely in the browser
- No backend services making API calls
- No user data sent to external servers
- Tools like JWT decoder, hash generators work offline

### ✅ Safe External References
- Only safe external URL found: `https://apsolut.dev/` (creator's website)
- Demo short URL (`https://short.ly/`) is placeholder only, not active
- No suspicious external connections

### ✅ Clean Dependencies
- All npm dependencies are legitimate packages
- No suspicious or unknown packages detected
- Dependencies can be safely installed after fixes

   - Provides security best practices
   - Includes audit trail

2. **Enhanced .gitignore**
   - Comprehensive environment file patterns
   - Prevents future secret leaks

3. **Removed Console Logging**
   - Eliminated information disclosure
   - Cleaner production code

4. **Malware Removal**
   - Deleted malicious preinstall.js
   - Removed unsafe npm script hook

## Verification Tests Performed

| Test                    | Result | Details                                     |
|-------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| Source Code Scan | ✅ PASS | No secrets or API keys found |
| Build Test | ✅ PASS | Application builds successfully |
| Dependency Installation | ✅ PASS | npm install completes without malicious code |
| File System Check | ✅ PASS | preinstall.js successfully removed |
| External URL Scan | ✅ PASS | Only safe URLs present |
| Environment Files | ✅ PASS | No .env files committed |
| Console Logging | ✅ PASS | No sensitive data logged |

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Remove malicious code
2. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Update .gitignore
3. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Create security documentation

### Future Monitoring
1. **Regular Dependency Audits**
   - Run `npm audit` regularly
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Review package changes before updating

2. **Code Review Process**
   - Review all npm scripts before merging
   - Check for obfuscated code
   - Validate external dependencies

3. **Security Scanning**
   - Integrate automated security scanning
   - Use pre-commit hooks for secret detection
   - Regular manual security audits

4. **Dependency Vulnerability Monitoring**
   - Current moderate vulnerabilities exist in vite/esbuild (development-only dependencies)
   - These affect only development servers, not production builds
   - Continue monitoring for security patches
   - Consider major version updates when breaking changes are acceptable

---
